              <h4>Professional Experience and Certifications</h4>
              <p>We hold a range of certifications from Offensive Security to other industry vendors, but most certifications are a scam. We have the experience to back up  tradecraft. We have a versatile background in both defensive and offensive security. </p>

              <h4>Research</h4>
              <p> We continue to train and keep up to date with all the latest security trends. We are never finished learning. Security is ever changing and adversaries are adaptive to new technologies. We are never complacent and we refuse to let our knowledge expire. This is an environment in which not only will you be exposed to new techniques and tactics, but also one that will force constant re-adaptation. We don't know it all, and we will never claim to know it all, but we will always do what we can to outperform our competitors.</p>

              <p>Our backgrounds in security are very diverse. Many people start their careers after college, we started ours as a hobby in grade school. What compels you to keep scrolling? Due to the rigorious expectations of the industry itself, most security professionals are self-motivated learners. Passion can be found, sometimes it just takes a push.  </p>

              <h4><a href="">Career Pathing</a></h4>
              <p>This offering is for students (college or otherwise) who are looking to breakthrough into security. Perhaps you have some experience with bug bounties, off-the-record hacking, or just new to computers. You're in good hands and we understand that everyone starts somewhere. All we need you to have is curiosity and passion. We will work with you on honing in on what fits your skillset.</p>

              <h4><a href="">Resume Molding</a></h4>
              <p>From resumes to cover letters, we have connections to recruiters and access to industry standard litmus tests which lowers the rate of your resume being buried under others. We've been in this industry long enough to know what attracts the eye of hiring managers, recruiters, and managing directors. If you're new to security, we'll expose you to the content that you'll need on your resume.</p>

              <p>Interviewing is tough. We'll make you resilient. Power dynamics, technical questions, and redirection, we will teach you techniques to bypass even the most subtle tricks that an interviewer is using to challenge your candidacy. We don't consider "coding challenges" or "labs" as part of the interview as that's an objective test of skill, but don't worry, we'll help you tackle those too. </p>

              <p>We'll teach you how to hack. We will cater the lessons to your ability and personality. Hacking isn't about structed learning. It's about breaking the rules and thinking outside the box. Even if you decide to join with no knowledge of hacking we will teach you until you leave with proficiency of an advanced persistent threat. Our opinion is that everyone can be a hacker, but not everyone can necessarily excel as one. Our initial consultation will give us some insight into whether this is a good fit or not. Regardless of what we think, the only factor that separates your success from failure is you. This is an offensive security career course.</p>

              <p>Maybe you like malware, but are scared off by assembly languages. What if you're not a developer and have no desire of becoming one? Everyone has sold to you the notion that you can only be in this field if you take computer science courses or graduate with an information security concentration. Misinformation campaigns, intentional or unintentional, know that it isn't true and we can work with you until you prove to yourself that you're more capable than your doubters. If you're interested in malware and digital forensics, we'll make it happen together. This is a defensive security career course.</p>

              <p>We have subject matter experts that can provide a deep dive into any of our offerings. Techniques used by adversaries are studied, understood, then consolidated for a digestible and immersive learning experience. We don't only specialize in computer security, we are experts at physical infiltration and prevention. Yes, you read that right. Physical infiltration. This is primarily a premiere mentorship relationship, but we are professionals by day so don't be afraid to ask for help beyond our standard offerings. Our breadth of knowledge from general information technology, holistic security practices, and subverting security controls, is as deep as an American V8 exhaust note.</p>
